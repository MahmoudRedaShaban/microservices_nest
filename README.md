## Description

This project is a NestJS monorepo implementing a bookstore application using a microservice architecture. It consists of the following services:

- **Bookstore API Gateway (`bookstore-api-geteway`):** The entry point for client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices.
- **Books Service (`books`):** Manages book-related data and operations.
- **Users Service (`users`):** Manages user-related data and operations.

The monorepo also includes a `contracts` library for shared interfaces and data transfer objects.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

This will install dependencies for all applications and libraries in the monorepo.

## Compile and run the project

To run the project, you need to start each microservice and the API Gateway. The order might matter depending on service dependencies and how they communicate.

Below are the basic commands to start each application. You may need to run these in separate terminal windows.

**Running the API Gateway:**

```bash
# development
$ npm run start bookstore-api-geteway

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev bookstore-api-geteway

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod bookstore-api-geteway
```

**Running the Books Service:**

```bash
# development
$ npm run start books

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev books

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod books
```

**Running the Users Service:**

```bash
# development
$ npm run start users

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev users

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod users
```

_(Note: The specific commands to run each service might vary based on your `package.json` scripts and how your microservices are configured to communicate.)_

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
